# Sinatra Porfolio Project
## Banjo Market
Banjo Market is an online marketplace for users to list their banjos for sale. Users can create, read, edit, and delete listings, view other user's accounts, and edit/delete their own account.

Banjo Market was created for Flatiron School's Sinatra porfolio project. The guidelines for the project were to create a Sinatra MVC app with CRUD abilities and ActiveRecord associations.
